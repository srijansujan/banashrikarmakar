<p align="justify"> Banashri lives with her parents and a younger sister in a one-room thatched hut, in the village of Bhadiswar near Murarai in Birbhum. The sole breadwinner in the family is her father who works in a local cycle repairing shop. Poverty and abject conditions notwithstanding, Banashri stood first in her school in Madhyamik with 89.7% and then went on to score 92% in the Higher Secondary, again topping her school, with generous help from some of her teachers. She joined Kabi Nazrul College in 2015 to pursue a bachelor’s in Bengali. In September 2016, Banashri got selected for the GNM (General Nursing and Midwifery) Training Course under the Department of Health and Family Welfare, Govt. of West Bengal, and she quit her bachelor’s to join the School of Nursing, LDV hospital in Kolkata where she is in her first year now. Srijan Sujan has promised to assist her in her endeavours. </p>
